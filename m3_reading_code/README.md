## Purpose

LLMs are excellent tools to interpret existing code (and papers). Reading code written by others is one of the more difficult and common tasks done in day-to-day work. 

## Task

To demonstrate this. An obfuscated piece of SciPy code is located in `algorithm.py`. The functions have been renamed, and the all comments have been removed. 

Use the LLM to explain: 

1. What algorithms are implemented in the code (Hint: there are 2)
2. What is the purpose of the `_edge_case` static method in the `alg2` class? Why is it necessary for the algorithm?
3. In the `alg1` class, a system of linear equations is constructed to find the derivatives at the interior data points. Briefly describe what this system of equations represents.


As a bonus, ask the LLM to code review the file for bad code smells and refactoring suggestions.
