# Bugs in the code: 


Bug in calculate_distances:
BUG: This function calculates the SQUARED Euclidean distance, forgetting
the final square root. While sorting by squared distance often gives the
same result, the intermediate values are incorrect.


Bug in get_majority_vote: 
BUG: In case of a tie, it incorrectly chooses the label that comes first alphabetically.


# Solution Path: 

Initial test failures: 4/4

User: Analyze the calculate_distances function for bugs @/m1_the_loop/knn.py

Agent: Replaced with: `dist = math.sqrt((point[0] - new_point[0])**2 + (point[1] - new_point[1])**2)`

Test Failures: 3/4

User: Next, analyze the get_majority_vote implementation for bugs.
